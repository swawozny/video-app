## About The App
VideoAPP allows users to save videos from various websites such as YouTube or Vimeo. The user can mark movies as favorites, filter them by the date they were added, and watch them without going to the website where the video comes from.

## Features

### Adding a movie 
On the home page, there is an input that allows you to paste a link to the video.

</p>

Currently, you can add a movie with:
- full youtube or Vimeo link
- Youtube shortcut link
- youtube video ID

However, an interface has been prepared that allows you to add additional options for adding videos from other websites in the future.

### Display a movie 
The Saved Videos page shows all the videos you've saved so far.

When you click on one of the movies, a modal opens which automatically turns on the movie.
